            <p class="introduction-text" style="order:1">An Unreal Engine 5 material inspired by the cosmetic shader system
                from <i>'Destiny 2'</i>. In <i>'Destiny 2'</i> the player can collect shaders to apply to the cosmetics worn 
                and used by their player character. These shaders give the appearance of different metals and fabrics on the players
                equipment. At runtime, this is a quick and effective way to grant the player customisablity as a reward for 
                progressing, though it would require a great deal of communication to execute in a large development team.

        <p class="project-text">My implementation switches between 4 sets of material properties based on a colour provided; red and green to metals and blue and yellow to fabrics. This could be achieved using vertex colours, though is currently applied via a texture sample. Some armour that has been painted to use this material effect is below, along with the Blueprint function used to switch material properties according to colour can be found at this link.
